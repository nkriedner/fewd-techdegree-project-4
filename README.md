This is my version of the "**Web Style Guide**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Frontend Web Development Techdegree**.

Starter files with in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.

I used the npm package node-sass for the development, but since this is not asked for the project -> I have put all node-files on gitignore.
